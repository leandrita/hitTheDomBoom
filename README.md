### General Info

_Objectives:_
The objective is to replicate the design of the landing page proposed by the client with the priority that the user can interact with the drum kit, so that when they click on each of the "pads", a different sound is emitted.
It should be able to work on any device and adapt accordingly.

_Project phases:_

- **Inception, Team Organization, and Kickoff**
  On the first day, the team needs to decide on the working methodology for day-to-day operations, identify the main items to be included (Product Backlog), select a Scrum Master to lead the development team, and appoint a Product Owner who will be responsible for asking questions and negotiating with the client.

- **Weekly Sprints** (2 weeks in total)
  At the beginning of the sprint, the team must agree on which user stories they will work on during the sprint (Sprint Backlog).
  At the end of the sprint, the team should hold a demo for the client, showcasing the completed user stories.
  Additionally, the team can conduct a retrospective at the end to improve their way of working for the next sprint or project.
  It is recommended to have a very brief meeting at the start of each day during the sprint, called the Daily Standup, where each team member shares their progress, challenges, and any issues they are facing.

_Project:_

1. Desktop version.
2. Mobile version.
3. The drum kit should have buttons overlaid on each pad and remain aligned when switching devices.
4. When clicking on each pad, it should emit a sound.
